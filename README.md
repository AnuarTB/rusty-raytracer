# Raytracer

![Rust](https://github.com/AnuarTB/lumen/workflows/Rust/badge.svg?branch=master)

This repo is just an experimental project that I have been doing, in order to learn Rust. 

It was in turn inspired by several projects listed below:

- [Computer Graphics from scratch (JS)](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/introduction.html)
- [Understandable RayTracing in 256 lines of bare C++](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki)
- [Ray Tracing in One Weekend (C++)](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
